# Getting Started with Markdown

**Date:** June 6, 2025  
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes formatting text simple. Whether you're writing documentation, notes, or even a blog postâ€”Markdown keeps it clean and easy!

## What is Markdown?

Markdown lets you format text with simple symbols. Instead of dealing with complex HTML, you can use Markdown for:

- **Headings:** Use `#` for headings.
- **Bold & Italics:** Use `**bold**` or `_italic_` to emphasize text.
- **Lists:** Create lists with `-`, `*`, or numbers (`1.`).
- **Links & Images:** Easily add references.

Here's an example of an image in Markdown:
